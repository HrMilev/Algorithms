# Binary Search Tree

The search tree data structure supports many dynamic-set operations. Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree with n nodes, such operations run in thera(lg(n)). If the tree is a linear chain of n nodes, however, the same operations take theta(n).
